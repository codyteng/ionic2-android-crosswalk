## Getting started

    cd ionic2-project
    ```
    
2. Add Crosswalk cordova plugin to your project
    ```
    ionic plugin add cordova-plugin-crosswalk-webview
    ```
    Now you should see **cordova-plugin-crosswalk-webview** appear under plugin folder
    
        |-- ionic2-project
            |-- app
            |-- node_modules
            |-- plugins
                |-- cordova-plugin-crosswalk-webview
                ...
            ...

3. Make sure that have installed latest version of **Android Support Repository** & **Google Repository**.
    ```
    android
    ```
    This will bring up Android SDK Manager, check if you have installed.
    
4. Add platform Android, if you have not
    ```
    ionic platform add android
    ```
    
5. Run project in Andrdoid device
    ```
    ionic run android
    ```
    
6. Now we have to verify if crosswalk is successfully packaged into your project.

                            |-- apk
                                |-- android-debug.apk **<-- if you see this, crosswalk isn't in**
                                ...
                            ...
                        ...
                    ...
                ...
            ...
